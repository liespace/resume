    %\item \ressubsingleline{Formal Collision Avoidance Analysis for Rigorous Building of Autonomous Marine Vehicles}{}{}
%    {\small
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item{Description: Collision avoidance is an essential ingredient to ensure safety for autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs). We investigate the fundamental rules of collision avoidance for AMVs. In the investigation, we present a formal model using timed automata to analyze the completeness and consistency of the rules, and then enumerate all the encountering scenarios and present the analysis from various perspectives.}

    %\item \ressubsingleline{LiDAR Based Navigable Region Detection for Unmanned Surface Vehicles}{}{}
%    {\small
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item{Description: We proposed a novel navigable region detection method for USVs Detection of the navigable regions for the unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) sailing on the narrow rivers is very important. We propose a scheme to process 3D LiDAR point clouds to achieve an accurate and robust navigable regions detection. This scheme consists of three parts: 1)Classification of river objects, e.g., river banks, bridges and vegetation, by a deep learning method; 2)Extraction of water surface by an improved convex polygon fitting method; 3)Filtering out the noise point clouds on the water surface by a customized particle filter to get the fine navigable region.}

    \item \ressubsingleline{Motion Planning for Autonomous Driving}{}{}
    {\small
     \begin{itemize}
         \item{My research topic during the Master period is motion planning for autonomous driving. I focus on the
         	fusion of traditional methods and deep learning methods. Specifically, I work on using the deep
         	convolutional neural networks (YOLO, R-CNN, etc.) to provide a more effective heuristic for
         	sampling-based planning methods (RRT*, Bi-RRT*, etc.).}
         \item{From Sep. 2018 to May 2019, I had proposed a method: using CNNs to generate a more applicable
         	sampling heuristic for RRT* used for autonomous cruising. The work derived an invention patent.}
         \item{From May 2019 to Now, I am working on path planning for autonomous parking. I propose a two-stages method using firstly CNNs to infer a path
         	directly and then RRT*-based algorithms to guarantee the path is feasible. A paper of that work is
         	reviewed by the ICAPS conference now.}
